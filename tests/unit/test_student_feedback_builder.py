"""Unit tests for student_feedback_builder module.

Tests that the feedback builder:
- Does NOT include numeric points/percentages/scores
- Includes error definition titles when present
- Works when no errors exist
- Works when no rubric exists (future)
- Formats feedback appropriately for student consumption
