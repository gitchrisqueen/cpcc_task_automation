## Pro Tips

💡 **Use Google Drive** for files you update frequently - just update the file in Drive, the link stays the same

💡 **Multiple files?** Upload a ZIP file instead of individual files

💡 **Clear button** removes the downloaded file if you need to start over

💡 **Mix and match** - Upload some files locally and download others from URLs in the same session
