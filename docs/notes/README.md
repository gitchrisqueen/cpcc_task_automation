# Development Notes

This directory contains miscellaneous development notes, work-in-progress documentation, and informal technical notes.

## Purpose

This is a space for:
- **Work-in-progress** documentation that doesn't fit elsewhere
- **Quick reference notes** for developers
- **Informal technical discussions** and ideas
- **Temporary documentation** during feature development

## Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [PR_NOTES.md](PR_NOTES.md) | Notes related to project feedback workflow migration |

## Usage

These notes are typically:
- Less formal than official documentation
- May be incomplete or outdated
- Useful for understanding developer thought processes
- Subject to reorganization as they mature

## Contributing

Feel free to add notes here during development, but consider moving them to:
- **Core documentation** (../ARCHITECTURE.md, ../CONTRIBUTING.md) when they mature
- **Module documentation** (../src-*.md, ../utilities.md) when they're feature-specific
- **PR summaries** (../pr-summaries/) when documenting completed work

## Maintenance

Periodically review this directory to:
- Archive or delete outdated notes
- Promote mature content to official documentation
- Consolidate related notes
